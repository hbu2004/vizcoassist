# Vizcoassist

*This standalone application empowers developers to upload a codebase and automatically generate clear, human-readable architecture diagrams. It provides both high-level overviews (e.g., system components, modules) and low-level details (e.g., function calls, dependencies), alongside summaries and insights like accessed data files.

# Why do we need this??

*In todayâ€™s fast-paced development landscape, software projects often grow complex, making it challenging for developersâ€”especially new team members or maintainersâ€”to grasp the architecture and dependencies quickly. Manual analysis is time-consuming and error-prone, while outdated documentation fails to reflect current code states.

# Uploading:

*The Codebase Analyzer offers a seamless file upload system, allowing users to submit their project files effortlessly through an intuitive interface. It supports multiple upload methods, including individual files (e.g., .py, .js, .java) or compressed archives (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz) containing entire codebases.

# Architecture:

The Codebase Analyzer transforms uploaded codebases into clear, human-readable architecture diagrams with ease. It employs advanced parsing and analysis techniques to map out both high-level structures (e.g., modules, components, and their interactions) and low-level details (e.g., function calls, class relationships, and dependencies).

# Data and files accessed

The Codebase Analyzer provides a comprehensive overview of the uploaded codebase by generating detailed insights alongside architecture diagrams. It compiles an "overall data" summary, including metrics like code size, module count, and dependency complexity, offering a snapshot of the projectâ€™s scope and health.
